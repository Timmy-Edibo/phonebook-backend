Antiglobulin, also known as Coombs reagent, is an antibody that is used in 
laboratory testing to detect the presence of antibodies or complement proteins
bound to the surface of red blood cells or other cells. 

It works by binding to the Fc region of antibodies that are attached to 
antigens on the surface of cells, and can be labeled with a signal molecule, 
such as a fluorescent or enzymatic label, to enable detection of the bound 
complex through an indirect immunoassay. The test using antiglobulin is 
called the Coombs test or antiglobulin test, and is commonly used in blood
transfusion medicine and autoimmune disease diagnostics.

what is d indirect immunoassay

Indirect immunoassay is a type of immunoassay that is used to detect and quantify the presence of specific antibodies or antigens in a sample. In an indirect immunoassay, the antigen of interest is first immobilized onto a solid surface, such as a microplate or membrane. Then, a labeled antibody or a labeled antigen that binds specifically to the target antigen is added to the sample, and any unbound labeled molecules are washed away. The amount of bound labeled molecules is then measured, typically through detection of a signal from the label, such as fluorescence, chemiluminescence, or colorimetry.

The indirect immunoassay is a versatile and widely used method in medical diagnostics, research, and biotechnology, and can be used to detect a wide range of analytes, including proteins, hormones, drugs, and infectious agents. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay depend on the quality of the reagents used and the conditions of the assay, and appropriate controls are necessary to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the results.




what is immunoassay
ChatGPT
An immunoassay is a laboratory technique used to detect and 
quantify the presence of specific molecules, such as proteins, 
peptides, hormones, drugs, or microorganisms, in a biological sample. 
Immunoassays use the specific binding properties of antibodies or antigens
to the target molecule to measure its concentration or presence in the sample.

In an immunoassay, a known quantity of an antibody or antigen 
that specifically binds to the target molecule is immobilized onto
a solid surface, such as a microplate or a membrane. The sample is 

then added to the surface, and any target molecules present in the 
sample will bind to the immobilized molecule. After washing away
unbound molecules, a labeled detection molecule, such as a secondary 
antibody or antigen, is added to the surface, which binds to the target 
molecule or the primary antibody/antigen complex. The amount of bound 
labeled molecule is then measured, typically through detection of a 
signal from the label, such as fluorescence, chemiluminescence, or colorimetry.

Immunoassays are widely used in medical diagnostics, research, and 
biotechnology, due to their specificity, sensitivity, and versatility. Different types of immunoassays, such as direct, indirect, sandwich, competitive, or multiplex assays, can be developed based on the nature of the target molecule and the assay format.
